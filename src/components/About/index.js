          Full stack web developer and chef experienced in making and shipping
          code and sandwiches in an agile environment. After nearly a decade in
          food service I'm transitioning into tech after completing a
          certificate program from the University of North Carolina where I
          developed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js just to name
          a few. I can see several parallels between the cycle of prep and
          service in a restaurant and agile development. My experience in
          restaurants has honed my ability to nimbly shift priorities as
          environments change while maintaining a consistently high-quality
          product in a team environment. Since I started learning software
          engineering I've worked on several personal and academic projects to
          build experience. All of these projects have further sparked my
          interest in building my skills and jumping into a new career in web
          development. I am a person who wants to constantly be learning
          something new and working in a field that's always improving and
          evolving is the perfect way to achieve that goal.
